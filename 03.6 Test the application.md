In this exercise, you test the application that you built.

Note

To complete the exercises, you'll need to use a few files. Download the [App in a Day files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/AIAD/AppinADayStudentFiles.zip) for use in this module. The file folders that are in this download include:

- **Completed modules with instructions** - Package files to import the completed exercise steps.
- **Machine-Order-Data.xlsx** - File used in the exercises.

## Task: Test the application

To test the application, follow these steps:

1. Select **Apps**, select the **Machine Procurement** application, and then select **Play**.

    [![Screenshot of the Play button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/play.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/play.svg#lightbox)

    The application should start, and the **Active Machine Orders** view should load.

    Note

    If your data doesn't show in the list, run the Machine Ordering canvas app that you built and then submit some orders.

2. Start a new web browser instance and then go to [Make Power Apps](https://make.gov.powerapps.us/home). Don't close the model-driven application.

3. Select **Apps**, select the Machine Ordering canvas application that you created in module 2, and then select **Play**.

4. Select two machines. Make sure that one of the machines is priced over $10,000 and then select **Compare**.

5. Select the machine with the price over $10,000 and then select **Submit machine request**.

    [![Screenshot of the Submit machine request button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/submit-machine-request.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/submit-machine-request.png#lightbox)

6. Select **OK**. If you didn't choose to create the submission success screen in a previous module, this option won't exist. You need to complete steps 3 and 4 again and then move to step 8.

    [![Screenshot of the OK button at the bottom of a prompt stating that a machine request has been successfully submitted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/ok.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/ok.png#lightbox)

7. Select two more machines and then select **Compare**.

8. Select a machine with a price under $10,000. Provide an approver email (or leave in the autopopulated manager email) and then select **Submit**.

9. Return to the model-driven application that you created and refresh the view. Sort the orders by the **Created On** column from **newer to older**. The two machines that you ordered by using the Power Apps canvas app should display.

    [![Screenshot of the Active Machine Orders window and the two devices that you ordered now visible on the list.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/active-orders.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/active-orders.svg#lightbox)

10. Open the machine name record that's priced **over $10,000**.

    The business process flow should now have five stages because this order costs more than $10,000 and needs **Capital Approval**.

    [![Screenshot of the business process flow with a box around the words capital approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/capital-approval.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/capital-approval.svg#lightbox)

11. Navigate back to the **Active Machine Orders**.

12. Select the other recent order that you created that is priced **below $10,000**.

13. The business process flow for this order should have four stages because this order doesn't require **Capital Approval**.

    [![Screenshot of the business process flow without the capital approval as a part of it.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/without-capital-approval.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/without-capital-approval.svg#lightbox)
