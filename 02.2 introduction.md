This module includes the following three exercises.

### Explore Microsoft Dataverse

In this exercise, you explore Microsoft Dataverse standard tables. Tables in Microsoft Dataverse are similar to tables in a database or worksheets in Microsoft Excel. You can connect tables together with relationships that model real-world interactions between the data.

### Add custom tables and columns

In this exercise, you create a new custom table named Machine Order, and you add columns that are necessary to track the machine requests. You also create a server-side business rule that defaults the estimated ship date.

Note

Throughout this lab we will continue to follow naming best practices while renaming screens and controls so that they are easier to locate as you work with Power Fx formulas that reference different controls.

### Connect the data from the canvas app

Now that you created the table to store machine order requests, you connect your Machine Ordering canvas app to this table and then add a form to submit machine approval requests.
