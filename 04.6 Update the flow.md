    The request is no longer visible because it already processed.

    Note

    All approval requests that are sent to the current signed-in user will be visible in the approval center, including approvals that are sent from any app or flow.

5. You can also use the approval center to view all requests that you sent and are awaiting response from the approver. Select the **Sent** tab in the upper part of the screen to view all requests that you sent.

6. Open the Power Automate mobile app on your mobile device.

7. Sign in and switch to the environment where the flow is deployed.

    [![Screenshot with an arrow pointing to the account button and a prompt confirming your environment.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/integrate-power-apps-online-workshop/media/confirm.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/integrate-power-apps-online-workshop/media/confirm.png#lightbox)

9. You can quickly approve or reject these pending requests from this screen.

10. If you have push notifications turned on and you're signed in to the flow mobile app, when you receive a new approval request, it triggers a push notification on your phone. Try out this functionality.

Congratulations, you successfully completed this lab. You created your Power Apps application and flow, and you connected them to a Microsoft Dataverse table. Now, you're ready to build your own apps and workflows.
