In this exercise, you add a gallery of all available machines to help make it easier for users to browse the list and get a quick overview of the available machines.

Note

To complete the exercises, you'll need to use a few files. Download the [App in a Day files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/AIAD/AppinADayStudentFiles.zip) for use in this module. The file folders that are in this download include:

- **Completed modules with instructions** - Package files to import the completed exercise steps.
- **Machine-Order-Data.xlsx** - File used in the exercises.

## Section 1: Add a machine type gallery

In this task, you add a gallery that lists the machine types. This gallery is a single-column, vertical gallery down the left side of the screen, with each cell displaying an image of the machine type. You use this gallery later as a filter for the machine gallery that you create.

1. Select the **Main Screen** from the **Tree View** pane.

2. Select **\+ Insert**, expand the **Layout** group, and then select **Vertical gallery**.

    [![Screenshot of the insert vertical gallery button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/insert-vertical-gallery.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/insert-vertical-gallery.png#lightbox)

    This action adds a gallery called **Gallery1** on the screen. The control tree view on the left will display this gallery with a rectangle, separator, next arrow, two labels and an image. The data pane will automatically appear when the gallery is created.

3. Select **Data** above the gallery, then expand **Connectors** and select **See all connectors**.

    [![Screenshot with the See all connectors button highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/show-all-connectors.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/show-all-connectors.png#lightbox)

4. Select **Import from Excel**.

    [![Screenshot of the Import from Excel option highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/import-from-excel.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/import-from-excel.png#lightbox)

5. In the **File Open** dialog, browse to the location where you unzipped the data file (for example C:\\AIAD\\PAHandsOnLabContent) and then select [**Machine-Order-Data.xlsx**](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/AIAD/AppinADayStudentFiles.zip) to load it.

    [![Screenshot of the Open button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/open.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/open.png#lightbox)

6. Select the **Machines** and **MachineTypes** tables and then select the **Connect** button. Now, both tables are added as static data into the application.

    [![Screenshot of two entities selected and an arrow pointing to the Connect button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/connect.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/connect.png#lightbox)

    Note

    In this lab, you'll work with tables that are imported from a static data file and embedded as resources in the app. If you were building a real solution, the same tables would likely be stored in the cloud, such as in a SharePoint list, a SQL table, or a Microsoft Dataverse table.

7. Rename the gallery as `galMachineType`.

    [![Screenshot of a gallery renamed.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/rename-gallery.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/rename-gallery.png#lightbox)

## Section 2: Work with galleries

Galleries provide a powerful way to visualize tabular data in Power Apps. It's important that you become familiar with customizing a gallery. Key components of a gallery are the gallery control, the template cell (first cell), and controls within the template cell.

To select the entire gallery, select the gallery in the tree view on the left or select the second or third cell. Selecting any cell that isn't the first cell of the gallery selects the entire gallery. Now, you can specify properties that apply to the entire gallery, such as the Items property, which is the data source, the gallery fill color, borders, and more.

To customize how each item is displayed in the gallery, you customize the template cell. Select the template by selecting in the first cell of the gallery, or you can select the pencil icon in the upper-left corner when the entire gallery is selected.

Now, you can add, remove, and customize the controls within the template cell. These changes repeat across each item or row in the table.

If you select the machine image in the template cell, you can change its size. Notice how the size of the image changes in all cells.

Additionally, you can test your gallery directly on the canvas by pressing the **Alt** key on your keyboard to activate.

You customize the machine gallery in subsequent steps.

You don't need to make the gallery pixel perfect; the purpose of this exercise is to get your app working with an acceptable user experience (UX). You can always repeat these labs to practice your pixel-perfect skills.

When you're working with control positioning, **X** refers to horizontal positioning, and **Y** refers to vertical positioning.

1. Select the **Machine Type Gallery**, go to the **Properties** pane, and select **MachineTypes** as the **Data source**.

    [![Screenshot showing the gallery data source value.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/gallery-data-source.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/gallery-data-source.png#lightbox)

2. Set the **X** value of the Machine Type Gallery to `0`.

3. Set the **Y** value of the Machine Type Gallery to `60`.

    [![Screenshot showing gallery template sizing.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/template-size.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/template-size.png#lightbox)

## Section 5: Highlight the selected item in the gallery

In this task, you use the **TemplateFill** property of the Machine Type Gallery to specify a highlight color for the selected item. You can decide how you want to indicate the selected item. You'll also change the label fill for this gallery.

1. Expand the **galMachineType** in the Tree View, **rename** the Label control to `lblMachineType`. Then, select the **lblMachineType** control.

    [![Screenshot showing a label inside of the Machine Type Gallery.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/gallery-label.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/gallery-label.png#lightbox)

2. Change the **Fill** value of the label to the following formula. This Power Fx formula sets the label fill to dark red for the selected item.

    `If(ThisItem.IsSelected,Color.DarkRed)`

    Alternatively, you could set the **Fill** property to: `If(ThisItem.IsSelected,ColorFade (lblHeader.Fill,75%))`

    We recommend that you use this approach so that the fill color matches the header label with a 75 percent fade. If you change the fill color of header label, the fill color of the selected item in the gallery will automatically change.

    [![Screenshot showing the label fill value.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/label-fill-value.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/label-fill-value.png#lightbox)

3. Try using the preview mode to perform a quick test of this highlighting. You can enable preview mode by holding down the **Alt** key (also known as the **Option** key) and selecting a few different manufacturers in the gallery. Notice that the selected item in the manufacturer gallery is highlighted. The preview mode ends when you stop holding the key.

Alternatively, you could select the **Play** button to enter preview mode. To exit preview mode, select the **X** in the upper-right corner or press the **Esc** key.

## Section 6: Filter the machine gallery based on the selected machine type

In this task, you use the **Filter()** function to filter items in the **galMachine** to only display machines that match the selected item in the **galMachine**.

1. Select the **galMachine** gallery.

2. Set the **Items** value to the following formula:

    `Filter(Machines, 'Machine Type ID' = galMachineType.Selected.'Type ID', 'Machine Type ID')`

    For alternate/European locales, enter the following formula:

    `Filter(Machines; 'Machine Type ID' = galMachineType.Selected.'Type ID'; 'Machine Type ID')`

    [![Screenshot showing the Machine Gallery items value.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/machine-gallery-items-value.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/machine-gallery-items-value.png#lightbox)

    Note

    If you get an error when entering the **Filter()** command, check the name of the machine type gallery. The name in the filter command must match the name of your gallery.

    The Machine Gallery should now show machines that match the selected item of the machine types.

    [![Screenshot showing a gallery of coffee machines.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/gallery-coffee-machines.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/gallery-coffee-machines.png#lightbox)

3. Select the **Preview the app** button found in the top right corner of the screen.

    [![Screenshot of the preview app button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/preview.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/preview.png#lightbox)

    The app should load.

4. Select an item from the navigation menu to the left of the **galMachine**. The machine gallery should show machines that match the selected machine type.

    [![Screenshot showing the close preview button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/close-preview.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/close-preview.png#lightbox)

5. Close the preview.

For more information about the **Filter()** function, see [Filter lookup](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/function-filter-lookup/).

For a complete set of expressions, see [Power Fx formula reference](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/formula-reference/).

## Section 7: Set up text labels in the machine gallery

To set up text labels in the machine gallery, follow these steps:

1. Expand the gallery **galMachine** within the Tree view pane and select the **lblSubtitle** label.

2. To add the dollar sign (**$**) to the Subtitle, change the Text value of the expression to the following formula:

    `Text(ThisItem.Price,"$##,###.00")`

    For alternate/European locales, enter the following formula: `Text(ThisItem.Price;"$##.###,00")`

    Note

    After you've entered the preceding value in the formula bar, it will automatically resolve to include your locale, such as \[-en-US\].

    [![Screenshot showing the setting of the device price.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/price-setting.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/price-setting.png#lightbox)

## Section 8: Conditional formatting to highlight machines above $10,000

You can make spotting machines that cost more than $10,000 easier by displaying the price in red font.

1. Under the **galMachine**, select the **lblSubtitle** that displays the price and then set the **Color** value to the following:  
    `If(Value(ThisItem.Price)>10000,Color.OrangeRed,Color.Gray)`

    For alternate/European locales, enter the following formula: `If(Value(ThisItem.Price)>10000;Color.OrangeRed;Color.Gray)`

    [![Screenshot showing the setting of the device's price font color.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/price-font-color.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/price-font-color.png#lightbox)

    Note

    As you're entering this formula, notice that autosuggest shows a choice of matching colors. Power Apps comes with a set of standard colors that you can reference in any property that accepts a color value. You can also set specific RGB color values.

    For a full list of color functions and colors, see [Function colors](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/function-colors/).

2. Select **Preview the app**.

3. Select **Commercial Espresso Machines** from the Machine Type Gallery. The price for machines that are over $10,000 should become red.

    [![Screenshot showing a list of espresso machines.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/espresso-machines.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/espresso-machines.png#lightbox)

    Note

    If a border appears around the Machine Gallery while in Preview mode, you can change the color to not appear. To do so, close out of the preview mode, navigate to the **galMachine** gallery pane, and set the border color to **Transparent**.

    [![Screenshot of the border color option within the Machine Gallery pane.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/border-color.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/border-color.png#lightbox)

4. Close the preview.

5. Select **Save** and then wait for the application to be saved.

## Section 9: Add a checkbox to add a machine to the Compare list

Now, you'll want to allow users to select multiple machines to compare before making a final selection on the next screen.

1. Select the **galMachine** from the Tree view pane and then select the **Edit gallery** pencil icon in the upper left of the gallery.

    [![Screenshot of the edit gallery pencil icon highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/pencil-edit.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/pencil-edit.png#lightbox)

2. Make sure that only the first item in the gallery is selected (not the entire gallery).

    [![Screenshot showing one gallery item selected.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/item-selected.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/item-selected.png#lightbox)

3. Select the **\+ Insert** drop-down, expand the **Input** group, and then select **Check box**.

    [![Screenshot showing the insert checkbox button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/checkbox.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/checkbox.png#lightbox)

4. **Rename** the checkbox to `chkCompare` and move the inserted checkbox below the price label.

    [![Screenshot showing the checkbox input placement.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/checkbox-placement.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/checkbox-placement.png#lightbox)

5. Change the checkbox text to `Compare` by changing the **Text** property value within the formula bar.

    [![Screenshot showing the checkbox text changed.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/checkbox-text.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/checkbox-text.png#lightbox)

## Section 10: Create a collection for the selected machines

When a user selects a machine to compare, you add it to a collection called **CompareList**. Consider this collection as an in-memory collection of machines that have been selected for comparison.

1. Select the **Checkbox** renamed to **chkCompare** from within the Tree view pane and change the **OnCheck** value to the following formula:

    `Collect(CompareList,ThisItem)`

    [![Screenshot of the oncheck value of the checkbox.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/oncheck-value.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/oncheck-value.png#lightbox)

2. Set the **OnUncheck** value to the following formula:

    `Remove(CompareList,ThisItem)`

    This step is required to make sure unchecked items are removed from the collection.

    [![Screenshot of the onuncheck value of the checkbox.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/onuncheck-value.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/onuncheck-value.png#lightbox)

3. Set the **Default** property of the checkbox to the following formula:

    `ThisItem in CompareList`

    [![Screenshot showing the default value of the checkbox.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/checkbox-default.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/checkbox-default.png#lightbox)

    The **Default** setting of the checkbox is a Boolean true or false value that determines whether the checkbox should be checked by default or not. Setting this formula ensures that the checkbox is selected by default if the item has already been added to the collection because the result will be true, for example, this item \*is\* in CompareList.

4. To test adding items to a collection, you can run the app in Preview (F5) or you can select the **Preview** button in the upper right. Select the checkboxes of three machines.

5. Close the preview.

    Each item in the collection has the information for each machine that you've received from the **Machines** data source, not just the fields that you display in the Machine Gallery.

8. Select the **X** in the upper right corner to close out and return to the main view.

9. Select the **Preview** icon again.

10. Clear all items with check marks and then close the preview.

11. Select the ellipsis (**...**) button next to **CompareList** under the **Collections** section and then select **View Table** again.

    Notice that all items are removed from the **CompareList** collection.

12. Select the **X** to close out of the dialog.

## Section 11: Set the default selection to the first machine type and test the app

To avoid getting a blank list of machines when the app starts, set the default selected item in the Machine Type Gallery to be the first item.

1. Select the entire gallery (by selecting **galMachineType** in the tree view on the left) and then set the **Default** property of the gallery in the formula bar to:

    `First(MachineTypes)`

    [![Screenshot showing the default value of the machine type gallery.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/default-machine-type-gallery.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/default-machine-type-gallery.png#lightbox)

    This action sets the selected item to be the first item in the table.

2. To preview the app, select the **Preview** button on the upper right of the menu. Alternatively, you can press the F5 key to preview the application. You can also test your app directly on the canvas by holding down the Alt key to activate buttons and other controls.

3. Your app should resemble the following image.

4. To exit preview mode, select the **X** in the upper-right corner.

5. Select **Save** and then wait for the application to be saved.
