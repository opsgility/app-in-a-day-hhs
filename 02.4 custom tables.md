In this exercise, you create a new custom table named Machine Order, and you add columns that are necessary for tracking the machine requests. You also create a server-side business rule that defaults the estimated ship date.

Note

To complete the exercises, you'll need to use a few files. Download the [App in a Day files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/AIAD/AppinADayStudentFiles.zip) for use in this module. The file folders that are in this download include:

- **Completed modules with instructions** - Package files to import the completed exercise steps.
- **Machine-Order-Data.xlsx** - File used in the exercises.

## Section 1: Create a custom table

In this task, you create a custom table to store machine order requests.

1. Select **Solutions** and then open the **Contoso Coffee** solution.

2. Select the **\+ New** drop down from the tool bar at the top of the page, hover over the **Table** option and then choose **Table (advanced properties)**.

    [![Screenshot showing the create new button and the Table option.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-table.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-table.svg#lightbox)

3. Enter `Machine Order` in the **Display name** field. The **Plural name** field automatically populates based on your entry in the **Display name** field. These fields are editable if you need to make changes. The system uses the plural name by default whenever a set of rows are shown.

    Select the **Enable attachments** option because it allows you to create notes on the machine order.

    ![Screenshot showing the New table dialog, with the Display name and Plural name fields filled in.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-table-dialog.png)

4. Select the **Primary column** tab.

5. Change the **Display name** field to `Machine Name`. The **Primary** column defaults to being named **Name**. For some scenarios, that label might not be the best one, so you can customize it if needed. However, the **Primary** column is always a text column that isn't changeable.

6. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Primary column tab, showing the Display name field changed to Machine Name.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/primary-column.png)

## Section 2: Create custom columns

In this task, you create custom columns for the Machine Order table. It might take a few minutes for your new Machine Order table to provision. Begin these steps after it finishes.

1. Within the **Objects** pane to the left of the screen, select to open the **Machine Order** table that you created.

2. Select the **\+ New** drop down and then choose **Column**.

    ![Screenshot of the add New button and the Column option highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/add-column.svg)

3. Enter `Price` in the **Display name** field, enter `Machine Price` in the **Description** box, and then select **Currency** from the **Data type** dropdown menu. From the **Required** dropdown menu, make the column **Business Required**. Select the **Searchable** option and then select **Advanced options**.

    Note

    Currency is a special data type that allows you to build multi-currency solutions. For each currency column that you add, another currency column will be added with the prefix **\_Base** on the name. This column stores the calculation of the value of the currency column that you added and the base currency. For more information, see [Using currency fields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/types-of-fields#BKMK_UsingCurrencyFields).

    ![Screenshot showing the Advanced options button in the New column dialog.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/advanced-options.png)

4. Enter `0` in the **Minimum value** field, enter `50000` in the **Maximum value** field, and then select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Minimum value and Maximum value fields filled in.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/minimum.png)

5. Select the **\+ New** drop down, and then choose **Column** again.

6. Enter `Requested By` in the **Display name** field, select **Single line of text** from the **Data type** dropdown menu, choose **Email** from the **Format** dropdown menu, ensure that the column is **Searchable**, and then select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Requested By form with the correct data entered in the fields.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-column.png)

7. Repeat the **Add column** process and add the following columns:

    | Display name | Data type | Format |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Request Date | Date and time | Date only |
    | Approver | Single line of text | Email |
    | Comments | Multiple lines of text | Text |
    | Estimated Ship Date | Date and time | Date only |
    | Approved Date | Date and time | Date only |

8. Now, you create the **Approval Choice**. You're adding it as a choice (as opposed to a two-option) because users likely have more than **Yes/No** options to choose from. Select the **\+ New** drop down and then choose **Column**.

9. Enter `Approval Status` in the **Display name** field, select **Choice** from the **Data type** dropdown menu, choose **No** beneath the **Sync with global choice** section, enter `Approve` in the **Label** field, and then select **\+ New choice**.

    ![Screenshot showing the new choice button and No selected for the Sync with global choice option.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/no-sync.png)

10. Enter `Reject` in the **Label** field and then select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot showing options in the Choices section.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/choice-options.png)

## Section 3: Create a formula column

In this task, you add a **Department Contribution** column using the formula data type and set its value to 10 percent of the price. In this scenario, this amount comes from the department manager's budget. In Dataverse, the "Formula" column refers to a column where the values are calculated based on a formula defined by the user. This formula can be created using a syntax specific to Dataverse, often similar to Excel formulas.

1. Select the **\+ New** drop down from the top of the page and then choose **Column**.

2. Enter `Department Contribution` in the **Display name** field, select **Formula** from the **Data type** dropdown menu.

3. In the formula box, enter the formula `Decimal(Price)*.1` and select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot showing the formula column behavior selection.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/behavior.png)

## Section 4: Create a business rule

In this task, you'll create a business rule that sets the **Estimated Delivery Date** to **14 days** after the order is approved.

1. Select the **\+ New** drop down located at the top of the page and then choose **Business rule**.

    ![Screenshot showing the add New button and the Business rule option highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-business-rule.png)

2. Select the drop-down arrow to **Show Details**.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the arrow that will show details.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/show-details.svg)

3. Change the **Business rule name** to `Calculate Ship Date`. You can add a description as well like `Set the ship date to 14 days`. Then select the arrow to **Hide Details**.

    ![Screenshot of Calculate Ship Date entered in the Business rule name field.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/calculate.svg)

4. Select the **Condition**, and then change the **Display name** to `Check Approved Date`.

    [![Screenshot of the condition selected and the Display Named field changed to Check Approved Date.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/condition.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/condition.png#lightbox)

5. In the **Rules** section, select **Entity** from the **Source** dropdown menu, choose **Approved Date** from the **Field** dropdown menu, select **Contains data** from the **Operator** dropdown menu, and then choose **Apply**.

    Note

    You might need to scroll down to the bottom of all scroll bars for the **Apply** button. Make sure that you select **Apply** after any change to the properties; otherwise, they will revert to the prior value. The **Business Rule (Text View)** will automatically update after you select **Apply** when you're done modifying the rule.

    ![Screenshot of the Properties pane, showing the fields filled in.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/properties.png)

6. Select **\+ Add** from the tool bar at the top of the page and then choose **Add Set Field Value**.

    ![Screenshot of the Add Set Field Value option selected from the Add dropdown menu.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/add-set.png)

7. Select the **true** side of the condition.

    ![Screenshot with a box around the true side of the condition.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/true.png)

8. Enter the following information in the Set Field Value **Properties** pane:
