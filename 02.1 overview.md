[Microsoft Dataverse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro/?azure-portal=true) adds data storage and modeling capabilities to Power Apps that are scalable and straightforward to provision. In this module, you use Microsoft Dataverse to model and store the data from the machine ordering canvas app that you built in a previous module. In the next module, you'll build a model-driven application by using the same data that is used by the back-office staff to process machine orders. These apps that you build on Dataverse use the same technology framework (Dataverse) that Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps are built on.

This module explains how to:

- Create a custom table and add custom columns to it.
- Use the Power Apps form control to populate the table.
- View the table data.
- Create a calculated column.
- Implement a server-side business rule.
