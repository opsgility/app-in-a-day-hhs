Create a machine ordering Power Apps canvas app - Online Workshop - Training
============================================================================

In this module, you begin building the Microsoft Power Platform solution, starting with a Power Apps canvas app. This canvas app is a machine ordering app that allows different Contoso locations to order coffee machines. Later, in other exercises, you build the data model, build a model-driven app, and add automation with a Power Automate cloud flow for approvals.

This module explains how to:

* Create a canvas app.
* Add screens to your app.
* Use Power Fx formulas in your app.
* Navigate between screens.
* Customize galleries on your screens.
* Capture a collection from your app.
