This module includes the following five exercises.

## Exercise - Create an approval request flow

The flow triggers when a new item is added to the Machine Order table in Microsoft Dataverse.

## Exercise - Conditional logic

In Microsoft Power Automate, you can add conditions to take different actions depending on a certain result, in this case, whether the request was approved or rejected.

## Exercise - Test the cloud flow

To test the flow, you run the Machine Ordering app and submit an approval request. Next, you verify that the request was sent to the approver and then approve the request. Then, you verify that the Microsoft Dataverse record was updated and that an email was sent back to the requestor.

## Exercise - Update the flow

In this exercise, you add two actions to the "if no" branch.

## Optional exercise - Add a Teams notification

In this optional exercise, you modify the existing flow to include a Microsoft Teams notification for your approval flow.
