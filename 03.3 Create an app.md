In this exercise, you create a standalone model-driven application that uses the same Machine Order table that you created in Microsoft Dataverse.

Note

To complete the exercises, you'll need to use a few files. Download the [App in a Day files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/AIAD/AppinADayStudentFiles.zip) for use in this module. The file folders that are in this download include:

- **Completed modules with instructions** - Package files to import the completed exercise steps.
- **Machine-Order-Data.xlsx** - File used in the exercises.

## Section 1: Create an application

Your first task is to create a model-driven application. This application serves as a container to identify all components that make up the application. It will also include a site map that defines the custom navigation that people use to navigate between the components (table views, dashboards, and other visual components).

1. Go to [Make Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/) and select the environment that you created.

2. Select **Solutions** and then open the **Contoso Coffee** solution.

3. Select the **\+ New** drop down from the tool bar at the top of the screen and then select **App** > **Model-driven app**.

## Section 2: Add procurement columns to the Machine Order table

In this task, you add new columns to the Machine Order table. The columns that you'll add will support the business process flow, which you'll build in the next exercise. When you use a business process, it consists of stages, which you can consider major milestones in completing the work. Each stage has one or more steps. These steps help users keep track of what they need to do before advancing to the next stage. Steps are simply columns on the table. To accelerate the process of creating the business process in this task, you'll first create the columns that you need.

To support this scenario, you add the following columns to the table:

- **Capital Approved** - You use this column in the flow to capture that the machine order has received capital approval.

- **Send Survey** - You use this column in the final stage. Currently, the team plans on manually sending a survey to determine how the user's ordering experience was, and they'll manually verify this fact after they've sent the survey. However, the team wants a future update to automate sending a survey in a future release.

1. Go to [Make Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

2. Select **Solutions** and then open the **Contoso Coffee** solution.

3. Select **Tables** and then open the **Machine Order** table.

    [![Screenshot showing the Machine Order table.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/machine-order-table.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/machine-order-table.svg#lightbox)

4. Select **\+ New > Column**.

    [![Screenshot showing the add new column button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/add-new-column.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/add-new-column.svg#lightbox)

5. Enter `Capital Approved` in the **Display name** field, select **Choice** then **Yes/No** from the **Data type** dropdown menu, and then select **Save**. A **Yes/No** data type is used in this case because, when you use it as a step in the business process, you want the ability to mark it as completed. The **Yes/No** column type is similar to a true or false column.

    [![Screenshot showing a yes no column type.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/yes-no-column-type.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/yes-no-column-type.svg#lightbox)

6. Create four more **Yes/No** columns and name them **Machine Received**, **Machine Configured**, **Send Survey**, and **Machine Delivered**.

    [![Screenshot of the Machine Received pane.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/machine-received.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/machine-received.svg#lightbox)

    [![Screenshot of the Machine Configured pane.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/machine-configured.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/machine-configured.svg#lightbox)

    [![Screenshot of the Send Survey pane.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/send-survey.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/send-survey.svg#lightbox)

    [![Screenshot of the Machine Delivered pane.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/machine-delivered.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-model-driven-apps-online-workshop/media/machine-delivered.svg#lightbox)

7. Add another column with the name of `Supplier Order ID`, select **Single line of text** from the **Data type** dropdown menu, select **Text** from the **Format** menu, and then select **Save**. Notice that you're not making this column required. You make it a required column in the business process later in the lab.
