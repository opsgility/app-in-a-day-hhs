In this exercise, you explore Microsoft Dataverse standard tables. Tables in Microsoft Dataverse are similar to tables in a database or worksheets in Microsoft Excel. You can connect tables together with relationships that model real-world interactions between the data. Each table contains multiple rows (records), each having data columns. For example, a Project table might have columns such as Name, Due Date, and Status. And it might be related to a Project Owner table, which might have columns such as Name and Email.

Microsoft Dataverse abstracts much of the typical low-level database management work to help make it easier for you to set up a custom data model that fits your application.

In addition to allowing for the creation of custom tables, Microsoft Dataverse contains a Common Data Model that consists of hundreds of standard table definitions. You can find the current Common Data Model schema at [GitHub Microsoft CDM](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/). You can also browse the Common Data Model by using the CDM Visual Table Navigator by going to [GitHub CDM](https://microsoft.github.io/CDM/). For more information, see [Common Data Model Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/common-data-model/overview/).

## Task - Explore standard tables

In this task, you explore Microsoft Dataverse standard tables.

Before beginning the exercises, go to [Make Microsoft Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/) and confirm that you're in your training environment for the labs.

![Screenshot showing how to switch from one environment to another.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/environments.svg)

1. In the navigation pane to the left of the screen, select **Tables**.

    ![Screenshot of the Tables menu.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/tables-menu.svg)

2. A list of tables in this environment displays. Select a few of the standard tables (such as **Account**) to get familiar with some features of a table.

    ![Screenshot with a rectangle around the Account button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/account.svg)

### Table properties

In the **Table properties** section, you'll find the table name, table type, the table's primary column, and table description. You can also copy the table's set name, schema name, or logical name from the **Tools** dropdown menu.

[![Screenshot of the Table properties section and the Tools dropdown menu.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/table-properties.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/table-properties.png#lightbox)

### Table schema

In the **Schema** section, you can navigate to the table columns, relationships, and keys. For this exercise, select **Columns**.

[![Screenshot showing the table Columns button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/table-columns.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/table-columns.png#lightbox)

### Columns

A table has a list of columns. In the following example, the Account table has columns such as **Account Name** and **Account Number**. Each column has a data type, such as **Text** and **Number**. The system chooses the data type when you create a column, and this value isn't changeable. The data type also defines many characteristics and behaviors of the column when your application runs. For example, a **Choice** column allows you to have a predefined list of values for use in your application. When this column is used on a form in a model-driven application, the visual presentation is a dropdown control. The column helps to ensure data consistency and allows for built-in support for multi-language applications.

[![Screenshot of the Data type column highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/data-type-column.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/data-type-column.png#lightbox)

For more information, see [Microsoft Dataverse Supported Data Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/types-of-fields/).

Return to the table by selecting the browser's back button.

Select **Relationships**.

[![Screenshot showing the table Relationships button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/relationships.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/relationships.png#lightbox)

### Relationships

Relationships allow you to manage relationships between tables. Supported relationships include one to many (1:N), many to one (N:1), and many to many (N:N). Relationships also define the behavior that happens when actions occur on the primary row in a 1:N relationship. For example, if the parent row is deleted, you can set up the relationship behavior so that all child rows are also deleted, or you can remove the reference.

[![Screenshot showing the Relationship type column.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/relationship-type.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/relationship-type.png#lightbox)

### Views

Views let you define how a list of rows are shown in the app. You can create multiple custom views, each having its own filtering and sorting criteria. For example, you could create a view so that only the rows that were created in the last week are visible. You could create another view for rows that haven't been updated in a year. Create views to make the application users more productive in filtering their data.

[![Screenshot showing the View type column.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/view-type.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/view-type.png#lightbox)
