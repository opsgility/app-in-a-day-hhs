The second screen is where users compare the selected machines and then choose the one that they want to submit for approval. This screen includes:

- A back button for navigating back to the main screen.

- A list of selected machines for comparison (carried over from the main screen).

- Other details for each machine.

- Highlighting of the selected machine.

In a subsequent lab, you create the database tables to store the machine orders, add an edit form to this screen to enter extra information, and then submit the request.

21. Select **Preview the app**.

22. Select a couple of machines, select the **Compare** button, and then verify that it takes you to the second screen.

    [![Screenshot showing the application in preview with two devices selected.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/device-preview.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/device-preview.png#lightbox)

23. You should be directed to the new empty screen. Close the preview.

    [![Screenshot of the close preview button highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/close.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/close.png#lightbox)

24. Select the **Main Screen** in the tree view.

25. Muli-select **imgLogo**, **lblUser**, and **lblHeader** from the Tree View pane. Right-click and select **Group**.

    [![Screenshot showing the Group button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/group.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/group.png#lightbox)

26. Rename the group as `Header`.

27. Select the ellipsis (**...**) button of the **Header** and then select **Copy**.

    [![Screenshot showing the Copy control button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/copy-control.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/copy-control.png#lightbox)

28. Right-click the **Compare Screen** option and then select **Paste**.

    [![Screenshot of the Compare Screen option and the Paste button highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/paste.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/paste.png#lightbox)

    The **Header** in the **Compare Screen** should resemble the following image.

    [![Screenshot showing the header.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/header-text.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/header-text.png#lightbox)

29. **Rename** the control of the copied `Header` and the child controls of the copied `Header` to match the screenshot below.

    [![Screenshot showing the header and child controls.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/header-label-compare.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/header-label-compare.png#lightbox)

30. Copy **galMachine** from the **Main Screen** and then paste it in the **Compare Screen**.

31. Rename the gallery in the Compare Screen as `galCompareList`.

32. Set the **X** value of the Compare List Gallery to `0`.

33. Set the **Width** value of the Compare List Gallery to `840`.

34. Set the **Height** value of the Compare List Gallery to `708`.

    The **Compare Screen** should now resemble the following image.

    [![Screenshot showing a list of coffee machines.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/machine-list.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/machine-list.png#lightbox)

    Note

    If only one machine displays on the Compare Screen, navigate to the Main Screen and back to the Compare Screen to refresh the results.

## Section 2: Set up the gallery

In this task, you set up the gallery to show machines that were selected from the comparison gallery on the Main Screen.

1. Select the new **galCompareList** from the Tree view pane.

2. Within the **Properties** pane, change the **Wrap count** to `1`.

    [![Screenshot showing the Wrap count of a gallery changed to 1.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/wrap-count-gallery.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/wrap-count-gallery.png#lightbox)

3. Select **Items** from the property value dropdown list, then change the value within the formula bar to `CompareList`.

The gallery will now show the selected items from the Main Screen.

[![Screenshot showing the application in preview with two machines.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/two-machine-preview.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/two-machine-preview.png#lightbox)

## Section 3: Remove and add controls to the gallery

In the **Compare Screen**, you're selecting a given item to get approved, so you don't need a **Compare** checkbox.

1. From within the **galCompareList** in the Tree view pane, select the **Compare** checkbox and then press the **Delete** key to delete the checkbox.

2. Add a new label to display other attributes about the machine. A method is to copy and paste. Select the first label in the gallery that's displaying the machine name. **Copy** the label (**Ctrl+C**) and then **paste** it (**Ctrl+V**). Rename this label to **lblItemFeature** so that you can easily identify it later.

3. Move the new label so that it's below the price.

Normally, we would edit each individual label's **Text** value manually in the properties pane, but with the _inline actions_ feature of the **galCompareList**, we can make these changes directly in the canvas.

1. With **galCompareList** selected in the tree view, hover your mouse over the gallery in the compare screen and select the **Fields** option above the gallery.

    [![Screenshot showing the fields inline actions option.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/inline-actions-fields.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/inline-actions-fields.png#lightbox)

2. Select the **lblItemFeature** drop-down and choose **Feature**. This changes the text value of **lblItemFeature** to `ThisItem.Feature`.

    [![Screenshot showing the machine feature option in the fields inline actions window.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/machine-feature-setting.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/machine-feature-setting.png#lightbox)

3. Use the ribbon tool bar at the top of the page to change the font weight of **lblItemFeature** from **Semibold** to **Normal**. Then change the **Size** property to `14`.

    [![Screenshot highlighting the font size and the font weight changed to normal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/font-settings.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/font-settings.png#lightbox)

4. Copy and paste **lblItemFeature** then move the new fourth label below the third label and rename it as **lblAvgCups/Week**.

5. Using the _inline actions_ feature, have the **galCompareList** selected in the tree view, then select the **Fields** option in the ribbon above the gallery, and change the **lblAvgCups/Week** text value to `Avg. Cups/Week`

    [![Screenshot showing the setting of the machine's average cups each week.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/average-setting.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/average-setting.png#lightbox)

6. Repeat the previous steps to add text boxes to display the other machine properties, the **Avg. Espressos/Week** value, and the **Description**. You can customize the labels by changing their Size, Color, Fill, and Font Weight properties.

7. Select the **Description** label inside the gallery.

8. Change the **Size** of the Description to `12`.

9. Change the **AutoHeight** value, located within the Properties pane of the Description, to `On`.

10. Multi-select all of the text labels inside the gallery within the Tree view pane.

    [![Screenshot showing multiple labels inside of a gallery.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/multiple-labels.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/multiple-labels.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Within the image above, you will notice that each label has been renamed to correspond with the purpose of the label within the app.

11. Go to the Properties pane and set the **Text alignment** to **Align left**.

    [![Screenshot showing label text alignment.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/alignment-text.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/alignment-text.png#lightbox)

The gallery should now resemble the following image.

[![Screenshot showing coffee machines and their descriptions.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/coffee-machines.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/coffee-machines.png#lightbox)

Note

To save time in this lab, you can add one or two of these extra properties and then skip adding the other machine properties.

## Section 4: Highlight the selected machine

To highlight the selected machine, follow these steps:

1. Select the **galCompareList**.

2. With the gallery selected, set the **TemplateFill** property to:

    `If(ThisItem.IsSelected,ColorFade(lblHeaderCS.Fill,75%))`

    [![Screenshot of the template fill value.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/template-fill.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/template-fill.png#lightbox)

    When building a complex formula, it can be helpful to utilize the **Ask Copilot to explain this formula** feature of Power Apps. On the left-hand side of the formula bar, select the **Copilot** logo, then select **Explain this formula** under **Ask Copilot to ...** The **Explain this formula** function utilizes Copilot to help explain the purpose and function of a formula.

    [![Screenshot of explanation formula.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/explain-formula.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/explain-formula.png#lightbox)

    The **Explain this formula** feature explains that the formula changes the fill color of **lblHeaderCS** to 75% when the item is selected

    You could have set a specific color or RGB value, but we recommend that you use the ColorFade function to match the header label with a 75 percent fade. If you change the fill color of header label, this template fill color will automatically change.

3. While pressing the **Alt** key, select a different item in the gallery. Notice that the selected item is highlighted in a light gray color.

## Section 5: Add an icon to navigate to the first screen

In this task, you add an icon to navigate to the first screen.

1. Select the **Compare Screen**.

2. Select the **\+ Insert** drop down, search for `left`, and then choose the **Left** icon.

    [![Screenshot showing the Insert dropdown menu and the Left icon selected.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/left.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/left.png#lightbox)

3. Set the **Color** of the icon that you added to `Color.Gray`.

4. Set the **X** of the icon to `220`.

5. Set the **Y** of the icon to `5`.

6. Set the **Width** of the icon to `50`.

7. Set the **Height** of the icon to `50`.

8. Set the **OnSelect** action for the icon to `Back()`, which will cause navigation back to the previous screen.

    [![Screenshot showing the onselect value of the icon.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/icon-value.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/icon-value.png#lightbox)

## Optional UI enhancement

Add **padding around the icon** by using the Properties pane. Set the padding values to `10` for the **Top**, **Bottom**, **Left**, and **Right** settings. As a result, the icon looks smaller but will still have a larger hit target for the select action. This pattern is optimal for most icons.

## Section 6: Test the app

Select **Save** to save your app. It's a good idea to save your app regularly. You can also test your app directly on the canvas by holding down the **Alt** key to activate buttons and other controls and then double-clicking to type into controls.

1. Go to the **Main Screen** and **Preview** the app by selecting the **Play** button in the upper right.

2. Clear any selected machines, if necessary.

3. Select one of the machine types.

4. Select the **Compare** checkbox on a few machines on the main screen.

5. Select the **Compare** button to go to the compare screen.

6. Tap or select a different machine in the gallery and then verify that the selection highlight works.

7. Select the **Back** button and then confirm that you return to the main screen.

    [![Screenshot showing the back button highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/back.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/back.png#lightbox)

8. Select **Clear Selection**.

    [![Screenshot of a list of coffee machines with the Clear Selection button highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/clear-selection.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/clear-selection.png#lightbox)

    The **CompareList** should clear and the **Compare** button should become disabled.

    [![Screenshot showing the disabled buttons.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/disabled-buttons.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/disabled-buttons.png#lightbox)

9. Close the preview.

## Section 7: Test the app on a mobile device

Congratulations, you've created your Power Apps canvas application. Now, you can publish and test it on a mobile device.

1. Select the **Publish** button located in the top right corner of the screen.

    [![Screenshot showing the publish button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/publish-button.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/publish-button.png#lightbox)

    This action publishes the latest saved version of the app.

3. Go to your device's app store application. Search for **Power Apps** and install the Power Apps application. Launch the app.

4. When the app starts, it prompts for your business or school account credentials. Sign in with the same account that you used to create the Power Apps application. The app that you created should appear in the list of apps. Select to **Run the app**.

## New Feature: Copresence within Canvas Studio

Microsoft is thrilled to announce the General Availability launch of **Copresence** within Power Apps Studio that allows you to collaborate with others in canvas apps. Copresence only supports one editor at a time, but other makers can enter the canvas app as readers in read-only mode. This allows readers to debug code, review screens, and interact with comments all together in the same session. This feature doesn't have to be turned on as it's already enabled by default for your ease of use.

The following are the benefits of using **Copresence** within the Power Apps Canvas Studio:

- Only one editor allowed, but other makers can now access the app within the Power Apps Canvas Studio in read-only mode.
- Icons and names of people who have the app open are displayed with indicators to show who is editing the app and who's viewing it.
- Read-only labels are displayed to indicate to makers that they're in read-only mode.
- While in read-only mode, makers receive notification for saved changes made from the current editor. Then, they'll be prompted to refresh the app to stay up to date on the latest version so they won't lose work or overwrite other's work later.

Note

When you are entering the email of the users in which you wish to share the app, you can choose to make them a **User** or a **Co-owner**. Depending on which you choose to enter them as, this will determine what their availability is as to what they can do within the app canvas.

The image below shows what the canvas would look like if you were viewing the app in **Read-only** mode.

1. At the top of the screen, you can see whether you are in **Edit** mode or **Read-only** mode. Here's also where you can view everyone that is currently viewing the app canvas.

2. Within the **Tree view** pane in the canvas, you can see what screen everyone is viewing within the app.

    [![Screenshot showing the read-only view in copresence.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/copresence-read-only.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/copresence-read-only.png#lightbox)
