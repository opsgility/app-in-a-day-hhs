Now that you created the table to store machine order requests, you connect your Machine Ordering canvas app to this table and then add a form to submit machine approval requests.

Note

To complete the exercises, you'll need to use a few files. Download the [App in a Day files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/AIAD/AppinADayStudentFiles.zip) for use in this module. The file folders that are in this download include:

- **Completed modules with instructions** - Package files to import the completed exercise steps.
- **Machine-Order-Data.xlsx** - File used in the exercises.

## Section 1: Add a Microsoft Dataverse table as a data source to the app

Open the Machine Ordering app. Make sure that you're opening the version of the app that's in the newly created environment that has the Microsoft Dataverse database instance.

1. Within **Power Apps**, select **Solutions** from the navigation pane to the left of the screen, and then open the **Contoso Coffee** solution.

2. Select **Apps** from the Objects pane to the left of the screen, choose **Machine Ordering App**, and then select **Edit** from the tool bar.

7. Select **9 selected** next to `Fields` in the properties panel.

    [![Screenshot showing the Edit fields option.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/edit-fields.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/edit-fields.png#lightbox)

8. Add, remove, and arrange fields as ordered in the following list. You can add the fields by using the plus (**+**) sign, remove them by selecting the ellipses and choosing remove, and reorder them by dragging the field to the desired placement.

    1. Machine Name

    2. Price

    3. Approver

    4. Comments

    5. Requested By

    6. Request Date

    ![Screenshot of the selected fields.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/fields.png)

9. Close the **Fields** pane.

10. Rename the form as `frmMachineOrder`.

    ![Screenshot showing the form being named as Machine Order Form.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/machine-order-form.png)

11. Rename the **datacards** of the form according to the following screenshot:

    [![Screenshot showing the renamed data cards for the form.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/form-card-renames.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/form-card-renames.png#lightbox)

16. Set the **Height** value of the form to `650`.

17. Within the properties pane to the right of the screen, change the **Columns** value to **1**. This setting modifies the layout of the edited form to be a single column.

    ![Screenshot of the Columns field being changed to 1 under the Snap to columns section.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/columns.png)

    The form should now resemble the following image.

    [![Screenshot showing the form.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/form.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/form.png#lightbox)

    Note

    You can always select controls, such as the **frmMachineOrder** control, from the tree view on the left to make sure that you're selecting the correct control. To move it, make sure that you select the form and not a control within the form.

    For more information, see [Understand data-form layout for canvas apps](https://make.gov.powerapps.us/hometutorials/working-with-form-layout/).

18. To create a new instance of the form when the screen is loaded, select **Compare Screen** in left tree view pane.

19. Select the **OnVisible** property of the screen and then enter the following formula:

    `NewForm(frmMachineOrder)`

    [![Screenshot of the OnVisible property selected.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/on-visible.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/on-visible.png#lightbox)

## Section 3: Set up the title column

In the next few steps, you set up each form field.

Your first task is to set up the title to display the machine type and machine name for the selected machine. For example, if the user selects the Smart Brew 300 coffee makers, you want the machine order to have the title of "At home coffee makers - Smart Brew 300."

1. Expand the **crdMachineName** data card under the **frmMachineOrder** in the tree view.

    [![Screenshot highlighting the expand button of the machine name datacard.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/machine-name.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/machine-name.png#lightbox)

    The default card contains a few controls:

    - **StarVisible** - A label control that has an asterisk (\*) and has its **Visible** property set to **true** or **false**, depending on whether the field is required or not. Because the **Title** field was set as **Required** when you set up the table, its **Required** property is set to **true**.

    - **ErrorMessage** - A label that is directly below the main data entry field that displays error messages.

    - **DataCardValue** - The text input control where you can enter the title. For this scenario, you set the title based on the selected machine.

    - **DataCardKey** - The label that displays the title of the field.

    Note

    Continue to rename all controls following the proper naming conventions. Screenshots following from here will have naming conventions applied that may be somewhat different from what you decided.

    ![Screenshot with a box around the controls of the data card.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/data-card.png)

2. Select **crdMachineName** in the tree view. Then, select the **Advanced** tab from the **Properties** pane to the right.

3. Select **Unlock** so that you can customize the card.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the lock icon.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/lock.png)

    Note

    For the next few steps, you'll use the Advanced pane to customize control properties within the form. You can perform the same customizations by using the property dropdown menu and formula bar in the upper left of the studio.

4. Go to the **Data** section and set the **Default** property to:

    `'galCompareList'.Selected.'Machine Type' & " - " & 'galCompareList'.Selected.'Machine Name'`

    ![Screenshot of the default property set to the preceding value.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/data-default.png)

5. Change the **DisplayMode** to `DisplayMode.View`. This setting prevents users from changing the value within the text box.

    ![Screenshot of the DisplayMode field changed.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/display-mode.png)

## Section 4: Set up the Price field

In this task, you set the price to the price of the item and then make it read-only.

1. Expand **crdPrice** for the Compare Screen within the Tree View pane.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the expand button for Price Datacard.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/price-data.png)

2. Select the **dcvPrice**.

    ![Screenshot with a box around the Data Card Value 3 option.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/data-card-value.png)

3. Select the **Advanced** tab within the properties pane and then select **Unlock**.

    ![Screenshot of the Price Data Card Value Advanced tab and the lock icon.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/data-advanced.png)

4. Change the **Default** property in the **Data** section to:

    `Text('galCompareList'.Selected.Price,"$##,###.00")`

    ![Screenshot of the default property changed in the Data section.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/default-changed.png)

5. Select the **Price Data Card** within the Tree View pane and change the **DisplayMode** property value to `DisplayMode.View` using the formula bar.

    ![Screenshot of the Display Mode property changed to View.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/display-mode-changed.png)

## Section 5: Set up the Approval field

In this task, you set the **default** value for the approver to be the email address of the signed-in user's manager.

You use Microsoft Graph to retrieve the manager's email. For more information, see [Office 365 Users Connection Provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/office365users/).

1. Select the **Data** icon from the navigation menu. Select the **\+ Add data** dropdown and then expand **Connectors**. Select **Office 365 Users**.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the Office 365 Users option under Connectors.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/connectors.png)

2. When prompted, select **Connect**.

    ![Screenshot with an arrow pointing to the Connect button on the prompt screen.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/connect.png)

3. Select the **Approver Data Card Value** renamed **dcvApprover** within the Compare Screen from the Tree view pane.

    ![Screenshot with a box around Approver Data Card under the Tree view.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/approver.png)

4. Switch to the **Advanced** tab within the pane to the right of the screen, and select **Unlock**.

    ![Screenshot with an arrow pointing to the lock icon, which will unlock when you select it.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/unlock.png)

5. Under the Data section, set the **Default** property value to:

    `User().Email`

    This expression uses your user's email so that you don't accidentally email your manager to approve your testing.

    In a real application, or if you wanted to try the expression with your manager's email, it would be:

    `Office365Users.Manager(User().Email).Mail`

    The expression would make an API call at runtime to get the manager's email address of the signed-in user.

    If you try it and get an error when calling the **Office365Users.Manager()** function, it might be because a manager isn't set up in the system for the signed-in Office 365 user. In that case, you can return to **User().Email**.

6. **Save** your work and return to continue editing the app.

The Office 365 User connector has access to many other valuable types of information. For more information, see [Office 365 Users Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/office365users/).

Your next task is to set up the **Comments** field by following these steps:

1. Expand the **Comments** Data Card and select the **DataCardValue** renamed **dcvComments** within the Tree View pane.

2. Under the Properties tab of the pane to the right of the screen, set the **Hint text** property to `Enter justification`.

    ![Screenshot of the Hint text field changed to Enter justification.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/justification.png)

## Section 7: Set up the Requested By field

Next, you set the **Requested By** field to be the current signed-in user's email, and then you disable the control so that the user can't change this value.

1. Expand the **Requested By** Data card renamed **crdRequestedBy** from the **frmMachineOrder** within the Tree view pane.

2. Select the **DataCardValue** renamed to **dcvRequestedBy**.

3. Switch to the **Advanced** tab within the pane to the right of the screen and **Unlock** the card.

4. Change the **DisplayMode** property to `DisplayMode.View`.

    ![Screenshot of the Display Mode property changed.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/view.png)

5. Under the Data section within the pane, set the **Default** value to `User().Email`.

    The email of the currently signed-in user should display.

    ![Screenshot of the currently signed-in user.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/user.png)

## Section 8: Set up the Request Date field

In this task, you set the **Request Date** field to be today's date.

1. Expand the **crdRequestDate** within the Machine Order Form from the Tree View pane.

2. Select the **DateValue** card renamed **dteRequestDate**.

    ![Screenshot with a box around the Date Value 1 card.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/date.png)

3. Switch to the **Advanced** pane to the right of the screen and **Unlock** the card.

4. Change the **DefaultDate** property to `Today()`.

    ![Screenshot of the Default Date property changed.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/default-date.png)

    The date in the calendar control changes to today's date.

    Now hide the **crdRequestDate** card. You don't need to show this field to the user since you include it as part of the form, the field updates when the form is submitted.

5. Select the **crdRequestDate** card from the Machine Order Form within the Tree View pane.

6. Navigate to the **Properties** pane and set the **Visible** toggle to **Off**.

    ![Screenshot of the Visible toggle changed to Off.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/visible.png)

## Section 9: Add a button to submit the form

To add a button to submit the form, follow these steps:

1. Expand the **Main Screen** within the Tree View pane.

2. Copy (**Ctrl+C**) the **btnCompare** button from the main screen, which has the correct color values.

    ![Screenshot showing the Compare items button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/compare-items.png)

3. Return to the **Compare Screen** and paste (**Ctrl+V**) the button.

    ![Screenshot showing the Compare items button again.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/paste.png)

4. Make sure that the button is larger and positioned correctly. You can resize to **260 x 40** by using the **Properties** pane on the right. You might also need to reposition the button on the screen.

    _Notice the button in this image is positioned to 1090 (X value) and 720 (Y value)._

    ![Screenshot of the resize button settings.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/size.png)

5. Within the Tree view pane, rename the button to `btnSubmit`.

6. Using the formula bar, set the button's **Text** property to `"Submit machine request"`.

    ![Screenshot of the button's text property changed.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/submit.png)

7. The button should be enabled only if a machine is selected. To do so, change the button's **DisplayMode** property to:

    `If(!IsBlank('galCompareList'.Selected), DisplayMode.Edit, DisplayMode.Disabled)`

    [![Screenshot of the button's display mode property changed.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/button-display.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/button-display.png#lightbox)

    Note

    You might notice the exclamation mark (**!**) in the formula `!IsBlank()`. Normally, if you only have `IsBlank()`, the check is for **blank** only. Adding the exclamation mark (**!**) in front of the formula modifies it to check if it's **not blank**.

8. Set up what you want to happen when the button is selected by setting the **OnSelect** property to the following:

    `SubmitForm('frmMachineOrder')`

    ![Screenshot of the On Select property.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/on-select.png)

    When the button is selected, the form data is submitted to Microsoft Dataverse.

9. Save your work and then return to continue editing the app.

## Section 10: Test the form

Your next task is to test the form.

1. Select the **Main Screen** within the Tree view pane. Then, select the **Preview the app** button.

    ![Screenshot with a box around the play icon.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/play.png)

2. Select a few machines to compare and then select **Compare**.

    [![Screenshot highlighting the Compare items button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/compare-three.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/compare-three.png#lightbox)

3. Select one of the machines.

    The **Machine Name**, **Price**, **Approver**, and **Requested By** fields are filled in already.

4. Add some **Comments**, such as: `This machine will satisfy our needs.`

5. Select **Submit machine request**.

    [![Screenshot showing a machine selected and the Submit machine request button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/submit-machine.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/submit-machine.png#lightbox)

    The button should turn disabled (gray) for a few seconds while it's submitting the request. If it doesn't, an error probably occurred. Select the **X** in the upper-right corner to return to the design mode.

    If an error occurs, a yellow error icon displays next to the **Submit** button. You can hover your mouse cursor over the icon to check the error.

6. Exit the preview mode by selecting the **X** in the upper-right corner.

7. Select the **Publish** button located in the top right hand corner of the page.

8. Select **Publish this version** and then wait for the application to be published.

    ![Screenshot with an arrow pointing to the Publish this version button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/publish.png)

## Section 11: Verify that a new item was added to the Machine Order table

6. Expand the **Compare Screen** within the Tree view pane.

7. Select **frmMachineOrder**.

8. Set the **OnSuccess** property of the form to the following formula using the formula bar at the top of the screen:

    `Navigate('Submit Success Screen', ScreenTransition.None)`

    [![Screenshot showing the On Success value of the form.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/on-success.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/on-success.png#lightbox)

9. Copy (**Ctrl+C**) the **Header** from the **Compare Screen**.

10. Go to the **Submit Success Screen** and paste the header.

    [![Screenshot of the header pasted and the top aligned.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/header.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/header.png#lightbox)

11. Using the **\+ Insert** dropdown from the tool bar at the top of the screen, add a **Text label** to the middle of the screen. Then, set the **Text** property value to the following:

    `"Your machine request has been successfully submitted. Thank you."`

12. Using the tools at the top of the screen, change the **font size**, **alignment**, and **resize** the label as needed within the canvas. For this example, we changed the font size to `14`, the text alignment to **center**, and resized the visual as shown in this image.

    [![Screenshot of the font size increased, the size increased, and the text centered.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/label.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/label.png#lightbox)

13. Within the Tree view pane, copy the **Submit Button** from the **Compare Screen** and then paste it in the **Submit Success Screen**.

14. Rename the button as `btnSuccess` and change all other control names as necessary.

15. Change the **Text** property value of the **Success Button** to `"OK"` using the formula bar at the top of the screen.

16. Change the **Display Mode** of the **Success Button** to `DisplayMode.Edit`.

17. Reposition the button to the middle of the screen.

    When pressed, the button should remove items from the **CompareList** collection and navigate to the main screen.

18. Set the **OnSelect** property of the button to:

    `Clear(CompareList);Navigate('Main Screen',ScreenTransition.None)`

    [![Screenshot of the On Select property of the button selected.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/ok-button.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/ok-button.png#lightbox)

    Note

    The semicolon (**;**) is used as a separator when multiple functions are called one after the other. If you're in a locale where the semicolon is used as a comma separator, then use a double semicolon (**;;**).

19. Select the **\+ Insert** dropdown at the top of the screen, searching for `display`, and then choose **Display form**.

    ![Screenshot of the Insert dropdown menu and the Display form option selected.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/display.png)

20. In the _inline actions_ pane that pops up, set the form's **Data source** to the **Machine Orders** Dataverse table.

    ![Screenshot with an arrow pointing to the expand icon and a box around the Machine Orders table.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/data-machine.png)

21. In the form's properties panel to the right, select **9 selected** below the Data source, and select the following fields to display: **Machine Name**, **Price**, **Comments**, **Approver**, **Requested By**, and **Request Date**. Rearrange and remove extra fields.

    ![Screenshot of the Fields menu and the fields to select.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/fields-menu.png)

22. Change the **Columns** value to **1**.

23. Change the **Layout** to **Horizontal**.

    ![Screenshot with a box around the Horizontal layout option.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/horizontal.png)
