    [![Screenshot of the Rename button.](images/c3d084b0557165a3722d749ff0ec1a90979eb42b.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/rename.png#lightbox)

3. Change the name to `Main Screen`.

    [![Screenshot of the renamed app screen.](images/febb1a77069e5c923388e0ea00c07029da48debe.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/renamed-app.png#lightbox)

    Note

    You can also rename the screen by selecting the screen name in the right pane and then selecting the edit icon, or you can double-click the edit icon.

    Tip

    It's a good practice to rename screens and controls as you create them so that they're easier to locate as you work with Power Fx formulas that reference different controls. In this lab, you'll be prompted to rename screens and some controls. For other labs, you can rename them as you want on your own. However, make sure that you rename screens as prompted in this lab because future steps might rely on specific screen names.

    Note

    All functions in Power Apps are case sensitive. As you start typing "User," a dropdown menu of available choices will appear. It's a good idea to pick from the autocomplete options. Additionally, help text will display in the upper part of the screen, showing the required parameters. In this case, no input parameters are required.

21. Select **\+ Insert**, expand the **Media** group, and then select **Image**.

    [![Screenshot showing the insert image button.](images/8f77b79cce43f050aa926ebf63d789689ec1f515.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/insert-image.png#lightbox)

    Note

    The **User()** function in Power Apps allows you to retrieve the email, full name, and picture for the currently signed-in user. App users will always be signed in with their business or school account (Microsoft Entra ID credentials), so this information will always be available for any Power Apps application.

Section 6: Save the application
-------------------------------

In this task, you save an initial version of the app. It's a good practice to keep saving app updates at regular intervals.

1. Check if errors have occurred in the app by selecting the **App Checker** icon.

    [![Screenshot of the app checker icon highlighted.](images/6c5fbec7eb1b75cd2b7d3203106402b7542b5bd4.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-apps-canvas-app-online-workshop/media/app-checker.png#lightbox)

    Note

    **Settings** may be located within the tool bar at the top of the page, or within the drop-down after selecting the **ellipsis** (...) within the tool bar.

5. Change the **Icon background fill** value to `Black`.

    In the application settings page, you can:

    * Change your app name.

Tip

In Power Apps, when you save a version of your app, the first version will be published by default and will be available to everyone whom you share the app with. Subsequent saves are only visible to the app maker in the studio. You'll need to explicitly publish it so that all app users to get the update.
