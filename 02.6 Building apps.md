Let's explore using AI to generate a table of data and create a new app within Power Apps using the Copilot tool.

Note

To complete the exercises, you'll need to use a few files. Download the [App in a Day files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/raw/master/in-a-day/AIAD/AppinADayStudentFiles.zip) for use in this module. The file folders that are in this download include:

- **Completed modules with instructions** - Package files to import the completed exercise steps.
- **Machine-Order-Data.xlsx** - File used in the exercises.

## Section 1: Explore AI Copilot within Power Apps

Before beginning the exercise, go to [Make Microsoft Power Apps](https://make.gov.powerapps.us/home), sign in and confirm that you're in your training environment for the labs.

[![Screenshot showing the corrent test enviroment.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/test-environment.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/test-environment.svg#lightbox)

Note

Within this lab, notice that your results for data may vary from those within the screenshots and images throughout the lab. This is because Power Apps is using Copilot to generate data for the lab that changes daily.

1. In the center of the **Home** page within Power Apps, there's a text field in which you can enter a prompt to search for an AI generated table.

    Within the **text field** type the following prompt:

    `Build an app to collect expense reports for employees that purchase microsoft laptops and tablets`

    Then, select the **Send** button.

    [![Screenshot showing the prompt entered into the text field.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/collect-expense-reports.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/collect-expense-reports.svg#lightbox)

2. Select **Got it** in the **Good data makes great apps...** window that opens.

    [![Screenshot of the Good data makes great apps window.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/good-data.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/good-data.svg#lightbox)

3. Copilot will likely generate multiple tables from the previous prompt.

    [![Screenshot showing the generated tables from the prompt.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/copilot-canvas.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/copilot-canvas.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Within this lab, notice that your results for data may vary from those within the screenshots and images throughout the lab. This is because Power Apps is using Copilot to generate data for the lab that changes daily.

4. For this task, navigate to the Copilot pane on the right, and in the chat bubble that says _Tables for collecting expense reports..._, select the table options button next to **Undo**. Choose **One table** from the menu and hit **Apply**.

    [![Screenshot showing the single table generated from the prompt.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/generated-table.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/generated-table.png#lightbox)

    Note

    If you'd like, you can add or modify the existing columns generated within the table by Copilot.

5. After applying, Copilot should merge the previous tables into a single table called **Expense Report** or something similar.

6. Let's explore further by modifying and adding to the generated table. Select the **Expense Report** table and choose the **View data** option at the top of the design canvas.

    [![Screenshot showing the view data menu option.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/view-data.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/view-data.png#lightbox)

7. Notice the table doesn't have a contact or Email column. In the text box at the bottom of the **Copilot** pane to the right of the screen, you can type a request to add a column. For this example we're going to type:

    `Add a column to track the employee's email address`

    Then, select the **Send** button.

    Note

    You may find that the column added above already exists within your table that was generated by the Copilot. If so, try requesting a different column to be added.

    [![Screenshot entering the new prompt to track employees' email addresses.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/employees-email.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/employees-email.png#lightbox)

    Notice how a new column that we requested and the corresponding data is added to the table.

    [![Screenshot showing the Suggestions section.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/suggestions.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/suggestions.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Remember that the data that is generated in your table may vary from the data shown within the table in the screenshots and images for the lab.

    Notice that to the right of the screen, you're having a conversation with Copilot while adding to and modifying your table. Here's where you can scroll through and view the changes or additions you made to your table.

    [![Screenshot showing the Copilot pane.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/copilot-conversation.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/copilot-conversation.png#lightbox)

8. Select a column name **drop down** from within the table, and select **Edit column**. Here, you can edit the column’s properties. For the example shown within the following image, the drop-down for the column **Email Address** was selected. Every column within the table displays different column properties.

    [![Screenshot showing the Column properties pane for the Category column.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/column-properties.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/column-properties.png#lightbox)

    Select the **X** in the top right corner of the pane to close out.

    Let's try adding more data to our table and the existing columns.

9. Within the **Copilot** pane text box, type and send:

    `Add 5 more rows of data to the table`

    Notice that five more rows of data are added for each of the existing columns within the table.

    [![Screenshot showing the newly added rows of data to the table.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/add-five-rows.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/add-five-rows.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Remember that the data that is generated in your table may vary from the data shown within the table in the screenshots and images for the lab.

    Now, let's try adding another column to our generated table to track the record's ID number.

10. Within the textbox in the Copilot pane, send the following request:

    `Add a 'Record ID' Autonumber column to track the record's ID number.`

    You should then see the column you requested added to your table.

    [![Screenshot showing the employee ID column added to the table.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/add-record-id.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/add-record-id.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Remember that the data generated in your table may vary from the data shown in the screenshots for the lab.

    Now, let's try removing columns within our generated table.

11. Within the text box of the **Copilot** pane, type a request to **remove** a column and select **send**. For the following example, we'll remove the **Employee Email** column we added previously with the following prompt:

    `Remove the Employee Email column from the table`

    Notice the Email column in the table is removed.

    [![Screenshot showing the removal of the Employee Email Address column.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/remove-column.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/remove-column.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Remember that the data that is generated in your table may vary from the data shown within the table in the screenshots and images for the lab.

    You can add and make more changes to your table as you wish, but for this lab and example, we'll keep the table as is.

    Let's create the app now.

12. In the top right corner of the canvas, select the **Save and open app** button, then select **Save and open app** again in the **Done working?** window that opens.

    [![Screenshot showing the Create app button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/create-app.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/create-app.png#lightbox)

    When the app first loads, a dialog might appear saying: **Welcome to Power Apps Studio**. If so, select the **Skip** button.

    You should now be viewing the app that was built for you. If the **Copilot** pane appears to the right of the screen, select the **X** in the top right corner to close it. That pane is available to you in case there are other changes you wish to make to the app.

    Note

    Remember that the data that is generated in your table may vary from the data shown within the table in the screenshots and images for the lab.

    [![Screenshot showing the app Copilot created.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-app.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-app.png#lightbox)

13. To the left of the screen, select the **Data** icon from the navigation bar. Notice that a **Dataverse** table was created by Copilot and is now added to your **Environment**.

    [![Screenshot showing the new Dataverse table.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-dataverse-table.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-dataverse-table.png#lightbox)

    Note
    
    Copilot is currently only supported for Dataverse. You cannot use any other data source at this time.
    
    Let's try editing the table now that the app was made.
    
14.  Within the **Data** pane, hover over the table. To the right of the table, select the **ellipsis** (...) next to the **Expense Reports** table.

15. From the menu, select **Edit data**.

    [![Screenshot showing the Edit data option for the table.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/edit-data.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/edit-data.png#lightbox)

    The Edit Table dialog appears. Here's where you can come and add your own columns to the table, or modify existing columns.

    [![Screenshot showing the Edit table dialog.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/edit-table-dialog.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/edit-table-dialog.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Remember the data generated in your table may vary from the data shown within the table in the screenshots and images for the lab.

16. Locate the **Record ID** column within the table and select the column header from the table.

17. From the drop-down, select the **Edit column** option.

    [![Screenshot showing the Edit column option for the ID column.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/id-edit-column.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/id-edit-column.png#lightbox)

    From here you can modify column properties for all the generated columns.

18. Exit the **Edit column** panel and select the **Close** button in the bottom right corner of the **Edit table** dialog.

    Based on what you learned in all of your other labs, let's add a few of those practices in.

19. Within the Power Apps Design Studio, select the **Form** within the app canvas.

    [![Screenshot showing the selection of the form within the app canvas.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/app-form.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/app-form.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Remember that the data that is generated in your app may vary from the data shown within the app in the screenshots and images for the lab.

20. In the _inline actions_ menu above the form, select the **Fields** button.

21. Within the **Fields** pane, expand the **Record ID** field.

22. From the **Control type** drop-down, change the type to **View text**.

    [![Screenshot showing the Control type of the ID field changed to View text.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/view-text.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/view-text.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Remember that the data generated for you may be different than the data shown in the images. In this case, the order in which the fields are listed may be different for you.

    Since we previously requested Copilot to set the Record ID data type to Autonumber, we don’t want the users putting in their own number; Dataverse is going to autonumber it for us.

23. Select the **Fields** button again to **close** out the pane.

    Now, let's make and add a new request to the table within the app.

24. From the top of the screen, select the **Play** button.

    [![Screenshot showing the Play button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/play-button.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/play-button.png#lightbox)

25. Within the pane to the left of the app, select the **+New** button.

    [![Screenshot showing the New button within the app.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Remember that the data generated for you may be different than the data shown in the images.

26. Although you could modify the form to autofill the fields for you, we're going to do so ourselves to show that the app works.

    Fill in the **required** fields (denoted by an **asterisk**) with any information you wish, and select the **Checkmark** in the top right of the form to submit.

    [![Screenshot showing the information entered into the fields and the checkmark button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-request.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/new-request.png#lightbox)

    Note

    Remember that the fields within the app may be in different locations than what you see in your app.

27. Notice that the new request is added to the list of requests to the left of the app.

    Now, select the **X** in the top right corner to **close** out of the app.

    If a dialog appears saying: **Did you know?**, select **OK**.
    
    [![Screenshot showing the new request added to the list within the app.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/request-added.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/request-added.png#lightbox)
    
28.  From the top of your screen, select the Save button to save the new app you created.

    [![Screenshot showing the location of the Save button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/save-button.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dataverse-lab-manual-online-workshop/media/save-button.png#lightbox)
    

Congratulations! You can now use your skills to build apps with Copilot.
