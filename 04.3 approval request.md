The flow triggers when you add a new item to the **Machine Order** table in Microsoft Dataverse.

- It uses the Approvals Service to send an approval request.

- The approver receives an email with options to approve or reject and to add comments.

- After the approver responds, the record in the Machine Order table will be updated with the appropriate approval status.

- An email is sent to the requester informing them whether the machine was approved or rejected.

Note

Two ways to create a flow are from blank or from a template. In this lab, you'll create the approval flow starting with a blank flow.

Note

## Section 1: Sign in to the Power Apps website

Your first task is to sign in to the Microsoft Power Apps website.

1. Go to [Make Power Apps](https://make.gov.powerapps.us/home) and make sure that you're in the correct environment.

    [![Screenshot of the correct environment labeled Contoso Test.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/integrate-power-apps-online-workshop/media/environment.svg)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/integrate-power-apps-online-workshop/media/environment.svg#lightbox)

2. Select **Solutions** and then select to open the **Contoso Coffee** solution.

## Section 2: Sign in to the Power Automate website

1. Go to [Power Automate](https://make.gov.powerautomate.us/) and make sure that you're in the **correct environment** where you have been building your apps for these labs.

2. Select **Solutions** and then select to open the **Contoso Coffee** solution.

3. Select **\+ New** and then select **Automation** > **Cloud flow** > **Automated**.

    [![Screenshot showing the create new automated cloud flow option.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/integrate-power-apps-online-workshop/media/new-flow.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/integrate-power-apps-online-workshop/media/new-flow.png#lightbox)

## Section 3: Set up the trigger

Next, you need to set up the trigger, that is, when the flow should run. You can trigger a flow in the following ways:

- Manually, from a Power Apps application

- Manually, from a flow button

- On a fixed schedule

- When an event occurs, such as a new item being added to a table, a new email arriving in a user's inbox, or a new tweet being posted on Twitter that meets certain conditions

In this scenario, you set the flow to trigger when a new item is added to the **Machine Order** table in Microsoft Dataverse.

1. In the **Flow name** box, enter a name for your flow, such as `New machine approval request`.

2. In the **Choose your flow's trigger** box, search for `when a row is added` and then select **When a row is added, modified, or deleted**.

3. Then, select **Create**.

    [![Screenshot of the When a record is added option under the Choose your flow's trigger box.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/integrate-power-apps-online-workshop/media/record-add.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/integrate-power-apps-online-workshop/media/record-add.png#lightbox)

4. In the trigger, select **Added** from the **Change type** dropdown menu.

5. From the **Table Name** dropdown menu, select **Machine Orders**. You can type `machine orders` to search for it.

6. From the **Scope** dropdown menu, select **Organization**. Scope allows you to limit when your flow runs. For example, if you choose **User**, the flow would only run for orders that you create. In this case, you're choosing **Organization** because you want this flow to run for records that are created by anyone in your entire organization.

20. **Save** and **Publish** your flow.

    Note

    When saving the flow, you may receive a warning stating your flow was saved, but approvals may not yet be configured. This is a warning which will resolve itself the first time you run the flow later in the labs.

    When creating your own approval flows, you might also include a clickable link that will be displayed in the approval email. In this scenario, you could include a link to view machine details in an online catalogue. You would include the **Item link** and **Item link description**.

    You could also set the **Item link** to deep link into a Power Apps application to view more details about the request. In this scenario, you might pass an OrderID or a MachineID as a URL parameter. Power Apps accepts URL parameters.
